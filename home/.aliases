function cdg() {
    cd ~/Workspace/go/src
}

## This changes cd to be cd then ls -lah. I found this here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/16106/how-can-i-create-an-alias-for-cd-and-ls
function cd() {
    	new_directory="$*";
    	if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then 
		new_directory=${HOME};
	fi;
	builtin cd "${new_directory}" && ls -lah
}

## This changed directories to desktop
function desk() {
        cd ~/Desktop/
}
function mark {
    export $1=`pwd`;
} 
## when I want to remember a directory, I can just type, e.g. `mark there` then to change back to it I type `cd $there`

Then when I want to go back to that location, I just type cd $there
